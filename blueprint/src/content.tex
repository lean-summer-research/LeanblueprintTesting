\section{Green's preorders (from \texttt{MyProject/GreensRelations.lean})}

\begin{definition}[Green's \(R\)-preorder]
\label{def:RRel}
Let \(M\) be a monoid and \(x,y\in M\).
We define \(x \le_R y\) iff there exists \(z\in M\) with \(x\cdot z = y\).
This relation is reflexive and transitive.
\lean{RRel}
\leanok
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}[Reflexivity of \(\le_R\)]
\label{lem:RRel-refl}
For every \(x\in M\), \(x \le_R x\).
\lean{RRel.refl}
\leanok
\uses{def:RRel}
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}[Transitivity of \(\le_R\)]
\label{lem:RRel-trans}
If \(x \le_R y\) and \(y \le_R z\), then \(x \le_R z\).
\lean{RRel.trans}
\leanok
\uses{def:RRel}
\end{lemma}

% If you have LRel in the same file, you can uncomment this block.
% \begin{definition}[Green's \(L\)-preorder]
% \label{def:LRel}
% For \(x,y\in M\), \(x \le_L y\) iff \(\exists z,\, z\cdot x = y\).
% \lean{LRel}
% \leanok
% \end{definition}

\section{Duality via \texttt{MulOpposite} (from \texttt{MyProject/MulOpposite.lean})}

\begin{lemma}[Opposite monoid correspondence for \(R\)]
\label{lem:RRel-op-iff}
For \(x,y\in M\),
\[
  RRel(\mathrm{op}\,x,\mathrm{op}\,y)\ \iff\ RRel(x,y).
\]
Equivalently, the \(R\)-preorder on \(M\) corresponds to the \(R\)-preorder on
\(\mathrm{MulOpposite}\,M\) via \(\mathrm{op}\).
\lean{RRel.op_iff}
\leanok
\uses{def:RRel, lem:RRel-refl, lem:RRel-trans}
\end{lemma}

% If you proved one-directional rewrite lemmas, you can document them here.
% Keep them commented out if you haven't defined these names in Lean.

% \begin{lemma}[Pushing into \texttt{MulOpposite}]
% \label{lem:RRel-toOpp}
% If \(RRel(x,y)\) then \(RRel(\mathrm{op}\,x,\mathrm{op}\,y)\).
% \lean{toOpp_RRel}
% \uses{def:RRel, lem:RRel-op-iff}
% \end{lemma}

% \begin{lemma}[Pulling out of \texttt{MulOpposite}]
% \label{lem:RRel-fromOpp}
% If \(RRel(\mathrm{op}\,x,\mathrm{op}\,y)\) then \(RRel(x,y)\).
% \lean{fromOpp_RRel}
% \uses{def:RRel, lem:RRel-op-iff}
% \end{lemma}
