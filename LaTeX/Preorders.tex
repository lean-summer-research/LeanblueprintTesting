% This file provides the blueprint for the definitions of Greens Preorders

% Example: How to create section header
\section{Green's preorders (from \texttt{MyProject/GreensRelations.lean})}

% Example: How to write a definition (no dependencies)
\begin{definition}[Green's \(R\)-preorder]
  % Regesters the LaTeX label
  \label{def:RRel}
  Let \(M\) be a monoid and \(x,y\in M\).
  We define \(x \le_R y\) iff there exists \(z\in M\) with \(x\cdot z = y\).
  This relation is reflexive and transitive.
  % Lists the lean declarations (with namespaces) corrosponding to the surrounding definition
  \lean{RRel}
  % Claims the surrounding environment is fully formalized.
