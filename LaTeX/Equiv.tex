% Example: How to write a theorem/lemma (with dependencies)
\begin{lemma}[Reflexivity of \(\le_R\)]
  \label{lem:RRel-refl}
  For every \(x\in M\), \(x \le_R x\).
  % Lists the lean declarations of the STATMENT 
  \lean{RRel.refl}
  % Claims that the STATMENT is formalized in lean (not necessarily proven)
  \leanok
  % Lists latex labels that are used to create the dependency graph.
  % This should list the depencencies of the STATEMENT (not proof)
  \uses{def:RRel}
\end{lemma}
% Optionally, include the following section to add a proof
\begin{proof}
  % Claims the proof is formalized in LEAN
  \leanok
  % Lists the dependencies of the PROOF
  % \uses{thm:example, lem:example2}
  Put proof description here.
\end{proof}

%TODO: test dfn vs lem vs prov vs thm vs cor
  % test \notready (claims the currounding environment is not ready to be formalized, needs blueprint work)
